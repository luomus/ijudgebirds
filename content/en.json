As we all know, many birds are under threat from the illegal wildlife trade. But it isn't clear to what extent some birds might be more threatened than others and why? What is it that makes a bird appealing? Part of the equation is obviously the bird's appearance. But what is it about how a bird looks that makes it attractive?", "Hard to say, right? And darn hard to quantify! Now that's where you come in. Time to look at some birds and tell us what you think of them on a scale of 😨️ to 😍️. Come on, you know you want to. And it's for a good cause!!", "→"]

    "question_1": ["1. What do you really mean by appearance/attractiveness?", "We are being deliberately vague about this. It's really up to you to decide what makes a bird attractive. But try to keep it to how it looks. If you have other feelings about a particular bird that aren't to do with how it looks, positive or negative, try to keep it apart for now and just focus on the physical appearance."],
    "question_2": ["2. Am I rating the photo, the bird, or the species of bird?", "We want to know what you think of the bird (or birds if the photo has more than one in it). Of course, sometimes a photo is going to make a bird look worse or better than it is. Don't worry about it though and just rate what you see in front of you. Rate the particular bird (or birds) in the photo. If you are familiar with the species and you know that typically birds of that species are much more beautiful than the bird in the photo try to forget that for the moment."],
    "question_3": ["3. How long should I take to rate the birds?", "Don't overthink it. We want your gut feeling. So rate the bird right away and move on to the next bird whenever you have stopped enjoying looking it."],
    "question_4": ["4. I have a very particular taste in birds. Won't that effect your analysis?", "We want to know what everyone's tastes in birds are. We are all different and we all like different things. Just like birds!"]
